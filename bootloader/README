This is the usb bootloader used in the ir-remote project.

"commandline" contains the linux commandline part to send the firmware to the device

"firmware" contains the firmware that goes into the bootloader section of the avr chip.

The firmware was modded to automagically run the bootloader first and after some 6 seconds or some run the main code.
