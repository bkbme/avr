The aim of this project was controlling your tv from your Linux box to switch the source input of the tv to the attached computer.

So the following happens:
- Turn on tv
- Turn on attached linux box
- Linux box tells the avr board to switch source
- avr board sends ir-remote commands to the tv
- Tv switches source to the linux box
- All good.
...
- When turning of the Linux box, the source of the tv is switched back.
